# Image files from Tau Station

This is a private project and not an official offer by the creators of
[Tau Station](https://allaroundtheworld.fr/game). The images in this
directory are source images from the game used under the conditions set
in the Tau Station FAQ, courtesy of Makes Dreams Happen SASU, France.

Since the official game website is no longer available on the web,
I'm linking to the game page at All Around the World instead.
