Typefaces
=========

For headlines I use [Share Tech](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech),
which is the same Tau Station used.

For other text I use [Oxanium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxanium).
Tau Station itself actually used
[Electrolize](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Electrolize).
But I'm not trying to achieve an exact copy; a subtly different look
is just right here. Also, I like the slightly more rounded style.

All these fonts are available on Google Fonts under the
[Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
