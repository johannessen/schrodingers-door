<h1><%= $mission->name %> – Author’s note</h1>

<p>
If you would like to tell me about your experience with this mission, please feel free to <a href=//snabelen.no/@ajnn>get in touch</a>.
I’d love to hear from you!

<p>
<%= $mission->name %> is a story about <a href=//taustation.space>taustation.space</a>, a rich browser-based text <abbr title="massively multiplayer online role-playing game">MMORPG</abbr> with thought provoking stories set in a post-apocalyptic science fiction universe.
Unfortunately, <a href=http://taustation.wikidot.com/tribute-page><cite>Tau Station</cite> was forced to close</a> before it left beta.

<p>
The game’s sudden end left me in search for closure. An entire narrative universe was effectively erased from existence.
At the same time, I felt grateful for having experienced it at all.
In <%= $mission->name %>, I tried finding a way to reconcile the uncertainty about how the narrative of the <cite>Tau Station</cite> universe might have continued with the narrative itself.

<p>
The locked door to your room is, of course, a metaphor for the game’s web site:
The web site being offline prevents access to the game <cite>Tau Station</cite>, while the locked door prevents you, the story’s reader, from accessing the space station sharing that name in the game universe.

<p>
Since the public web server is down permanently, the game <cite>Tau Station</cite> clearly is dead.
Yet, for all we know, it might still be alive somewhere, on an internal server.
We just can’t observe whether that is in fact the case or not.

<p>
Such difficulties in attributing the state of unobserved systems are familiar from quantum theory.
The thought experiment known as <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat>Schrödinger’s cat</a> illustrates that under certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, an animal might exist dead and alive simultaneously.
The name of this story quite obviously is a nod of the head to that paradox.

<p>
But we don’t even have to resort to a paradox here to see that the state of <cite>Tau Station</cite> is at least somewhat uncertain.
Personally, I believe that both the content of <cite>Tau Station</cite> and its technical platform hold immense value.
<!--
By content, I mean narrative and artwork.
Tau Station was the result of many years of hard work, after all, and it showed.
-->
It’s not a stretch to imagine that one or both of these could be salvaged in part or in whole, one day allowing if not <cite>Tau Station</cite> as we know it, then something rather similar to exist.
<em>Perhaps</em> the <cite>Tau Station</cite> team is working on that right now.
But perhaps not.
It’s not for me to say.

<p>
I <em>can</em> say that a narrative locked inside the walls of a web app like <cite>Tau Station</cite> has a higher risk of becoming lost from humanity’s cultural heritage than pretty much all other works of art.
<a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library>Printed books</a> can be archived, <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine>static web sites</a> can be archived, <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_museum>classic video games</a> can be archived; an interactive web experience like <cite>Tau Station</cite> cannot.
It inherently relies on the server, which is now gone.
In the <cite>Tau Station</cite> universe, a similar loss of knowledge occurred on an even grander scale during <a href=http://taustation.wikidot.com/the-catastrophe>the Catastrophe</a>.
This loss is part of why I continue to hope for some kind of a solution.

<p>
In the meantime, I offer this story as a tribute to <cite>Tau Station</cite>.
The story’s presentation is somewhat similar to the way in which many stories (or missions) in the game were presented.
<%= $mission->name %> is, however, more linear than the typical game mission.
The central story element being you sitting alone in your cabin, <%= $mission->name %> also doesn’t contain any conversations with other characters, which greatly simplified the technical requirements at my end.

<p>
In writing <%= $mission->name %>, I relied on the <a href=http://taustation.wikidot.com>Tau Station Wiki</a> quite a lot.
Among other things, the wiki contains partial transcripts of many game missions, which alleviates the cultural loss explained above to a small degree.

<p>
I tried to include a few references to concepts and missions readers would know from having played <cite>Tau Station</cite>, listed here in no particular order and without claiming completeness.
While I do have memories of many of the game’s missions and even notes on some, the wiki allowed me to verify these and to weave them together into a (hopefully) coherent narrative.
